# A Guided Tour Of The Autonomous Data Warehouse Console

## Introduction

Autonomous Data Warehouse comes with a built-in suite of tools that can help you with many of the typical data warehouse tasks. This tool suite is complementary to various capabilities accessible via the SQL command line, which themselves are covered by other workshops.  To explore how these new built-in tools can make you work smarter and faster you will take on the role of a departmental analyst at MovieStream. As a **departmental analyst** you have been assigned the task of reviewing the sales data from Q2 of fiscal year 2020 and to make recommendations for a marketing campaign based on this analysis.

  **Note**: MovieStream's financial year is aligned with the calendar year, so FYQ2 is April-June.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

2. This will take you to the Autonomous Data Warehouse **Database Actions** home page (shown below). This page has a card for each of the most common tasks that the data warehouse user would want to perform. The cards are grouped by theme. For example, here you see groups for Development and Data Tools. Each card has a title and description.
